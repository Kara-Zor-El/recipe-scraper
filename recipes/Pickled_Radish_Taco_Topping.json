  "instructions": [
    "Begin by making a basic salt water brine.  Combine 2 cups of hot water with one tablespoon of pickling salt.  ",
    "Slice carrots into 1 inch matchsticks.  Slice radishes into matchsticks or thin slices.  Roughly chop cilantro.  ",
    "Toss all the ingredients to combine.  Pack into a mason jar.  ",
    "Cover the vegetables with salt water brine.  ",
    "Cover with a fermenting weight and lid.  Or use a little jar on top to keep oxygen out.  The jar will bubble and spit as it ferments so set it on top of a plate to catch that liquid.  ",
    "Leave it on the counter for about two weeks.  Then taste test it to see if it's fermented enough. ",
    " If the flavor is not very strong yet you could let it ferment longer.  Ambient temperature affects the fermentation process.  It could take as little as one and a half weeks in warm summer, or up to three weeks when very cool.  ",
    "Store in the fridge.  Add it to your favorite tacos!"
