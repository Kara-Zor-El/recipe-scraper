  "instructions": [
    "Cook tapioca in 16 Cups water for 30 minutes, then remove from the heat and let sit 30 minutes. Rinse.  Test the \"boba\" to see if they are done.  If you have extra-large tapioca you may need to repeat this boiling a second time.  The boba should be chewy, not mushy and they do not have to be clear all the way through to be \"done.\"  ",
    "Make brown sugar syrup by mixing 2 tablespoons water with the brown sugar and molasses and stir the boba into it.  Set aside to absorb flavor and dark color.  ",
    "Crush chai spices to infuse better.  Split vanilla bean.  Add to 2 cups water and simmer 15 minutes.  Add milk and sugar and cook 5 more minutes.  Remove from heat and strain.  Allow to cool.",
    "Split boba between 8 8-oz cups.  Swirl boba syrup around in the cups up the sides.  This will create a swirly design on the sides of the cup when you add the milk.  ",
    "Add a scoop of ice.  Pour in milk--divide between the 8 cups. ",
    "Serve immediately with a milkshake straw.  Enjoy!"
